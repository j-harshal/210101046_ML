## Project Description
This project provides a detailed analysis of recruitment data, including:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and transforming the data to make it suitable for modeling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing key features and relationships to gain insights.
- **Model Implementation**: Using various classification models to predict the employment status of candidates.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains details about candidates' academic backgrounds, demographic features, and placement status. Key features include:
- **Gender**: Male/Female
- **Academic Scores**: SSC, HSC, Degree percentages
- **Specializations**: Different fields of study
- **Work Experience**: Yes/No
- **Placement Status**: Placed/Not Placed

## Usage
# After installation, you can run the Jupyter notebook to explore the data and train models:

# Launch Jupyter Notebook:
 jupyter notebook

 Open the 210101046_Recruitment_EDA_&_Classification.ipynb notebook.
 Run the cells sequentially to perform EDA, preprocess the data, and train the classification models.

## Models Implemented
 Several classification models are implemented in this project to predict employment status:

 - Logistic Regression
 - Decision Trees
 - Random Forest
 - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
 - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
 - Naive Bayes
 - Gradient Boosting
 - XGBoost

# These models are evaluated to determine the best-performing one for this classification task.

## Model Evaluation
# The models are evaluated using the following metrics:

 - Accuracy: The percentage of correctly classified instances.
 - Precision: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total number of positive predictions.
 - Recall: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total number of actual positive instances.
 - F1 Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two.
 - Confusion Matrix: A table used to describe the performance of a classification model on a set of test data for which the true values are known.

## Results
 The performance of each model is summarized, and the best model is selected based on the evaluation metrics.
 The results provide insights into the most effective approach for predicting candidate placements.
